Project Plan
-------------

Project Title: Flappy B58ird

Provide a one paragraph description of your project:
The project is a recreation of the famous mobile game Flappy Bird. It is titled Flappy B58ird (The 8 seen as a B) because we are recreating it in CSCB58. Connected to the FPGA will be a keyboard and monitor. The space bar on the keyboard will propel the bird upwards, while the bird falls on its own. The goal is to make your way through oncoming obstacles, in which there will be a gap for the bird to fly through. A VGA connection is used to display the bird and obstacles on the monitor. A score is shown representing the amount of obstacles the bird has flown through. Main menu to start game, end game screen displays final score and takes player back to main menu.

What is your plan for the first week?
Necessary aspects of the game implemented with FSM model. Drawing components on screen with VGA, oncoming obstacles represented by large shift registers and controlled by timer, bird jumping in place with keyboard.

What is your plan for the second week?
Continuing on same FSM model, determine when the bird has collided with an obstacle, keep track of score.

What is your plan for the third week?
On a higher-level FSM (or possibly within same FSM), have player navigate from main menu to playing the game, displaying their score on end game screen once the game is over, and returning them back to the main menu.

What is your backup plan if things donâ€™t work out as planned?
Spend more time on basic gameplay aspects, just getting the bird the fly up and fall down, have obstacles approach the bird. Game may just start instantly when loaded up, game may just stop once the bird hits an obstacle.


Weekly Reports
-------------
<In this space, provide a report each week of what worked and what didn't, and what (if any) changes were made to your proposal>

[This is an example of a report where things didn't go so well.]
Week 1:
We added and tested the sensors and the main FSM.
The distance sensor we had intended to use didn't work as expected (wasn't precise enough at further distances, only seems to work accurately within 5-10cm), so instead we've decided to change the project to use a light sensor instead.
Had trouble getting the FSM to work (kept getting stuck in state 101, took longer to debug than expected), so we may not be able to add the high score feature. We have updated that in the project description as an optional feature.
